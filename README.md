### Hi there, I'm Max ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Kotlin & Java developer dealing mostly with data analytics, visualization and simulation.

I like to create stuff:
- :steam_locomotive: Overly ambitious software frameworks
- :radio: Hardware & electronics
- :hammer: Sometimes even furniture

In my free time, I maintain [kool](https://github.com/fabmax/kool) a Kotlin multi-platform game framework.
