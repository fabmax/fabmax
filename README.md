### Hi there, I'm Max 👋

I'm a passionate Kotlin & Java developer dealing mostly with data analytics, visualization and simulation.

In my free time, I like to create stuff:
- :steam_locomotive: Overly ambitious software frameworks
- :radio: Hardware & electronics
- :hammer: Sometimes even furniture
